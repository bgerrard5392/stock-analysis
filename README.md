# Stock Analysis

## Overview of Project
For this project I analyzed stock information from 2017 and 2018 for Steveâ€™s parents to help them determine whether or not the stocks are worth investing in. The data consists of 12 different stocks, their ticker value, stock issue date, opening/closing price, highest/lowest stock price and volume.
